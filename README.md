## Usage

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8cfa5b-f78f-4a27-8348-8a38e518bf98

Once you've seen you triggered a build right inside of Claude, you can then go to the repository in question:

<img width="1239" height="400" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-27 at 10 35 49 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b00b3ec-32d3-4e87-9c9c-f6286cc5d070" />

As you can see it's been triggered by Travis MCP. What's more, if you have a build number that you want to restart, you can do that as well:

### Getting Build Logs

There are multiple ways to retrieve build logs:

#### 1. Quick Method (Recommended)
Use `travis_getBuildLogs` with just a build ID to get all logs at once:

```
Ask Claude: "Show me all logs for build 276783990"
```

This automatically fetches all jobs and their logs in a single request, as you'll see in this video below:

[![Watch the video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93cb09b1-2dbd-4dd4-8cd6-1cbf9cb2a1a2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93cb09b1-2dbd-4dd4-8cd6-1cbf9cb2a1a2)


#### 2. Detailed Method
When you need more control, first get job details, then fetch specific logs:

**Step 1:** Get all job IDs and their details
```
Ask Claude: "Get job details for build 276783990"
```

This uses `travis_getBuildJobs` and returns:
```json
{
  "buildId": 276783990,
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": 123456789,
      "number": "276783990.1",
      "state": "passed",
      "config": { "language": "node_js", "node_js": "18" },
      "allow_failure": false
    },
    {
      "id": 123456790,
      "number": "276783990.2",
      "state": "failed",
      "config": { "language": "node_js", "node_js": "20" },
      "allow_failure": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2:** Fetch log for a specific job
```
Ask Claude: "Show me the log for job 123456790"
```

This uses the `travis:build-log?jobId={jobId}` resource to fetch just that job's log.

**Use case:** This method is useful when:
- You want to inspect only failed jobs
- You need to see job configurations before viewing logs
- You're debugging specific test matrix configurations

#### 3. Resource Method
Directly use the resource URI for individual job logs:
```
travis:build-log?jobId=123456789
```

### Getting Organization/User Statistics

Use `travis_getOwnerStats` to get an overview of a user or organization's Travis CI activity:

```
Ask Claude: "Show me Travis CI stats for travis-ci"
Ask Claude: "Get statistics for the rails organization"
```

This returns:
- Owner type (User/Organization)
- Name and GitHub ID
- Total and active repository counts
- Recent active repositories with their last build status
- Visual indicators: ✓ (passed), ✗ (failed), ○ (no builds)

**Example output:**
```
Travis CI Statistics for: travis-ci
================================================================================

Owner Type: User
Name: Travis CI
GitHub ID: 639823

Repository Statistics:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total Repositories: 100
Active Repositories: 100

Recent Active Repositories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ travis-ci/travis-web
   Last Build: #12345 - passed (2025-11-10T10:30:00Z)
✗ travis-ci/travis-api
   Last Build: #67890 - failed (2025-11-09T15:20:00Z)
```

### Checking Travis CI Service Status

Use `travis_getServiceStatus` to check if Travis CI is experiencing issues:

```
Ask Claude: "Is Travis CI down?"
Ask Claude: "Check Travis CI status"
Ask Claude: "What's the Travis CI service status?"
```

This returns:
- Overall operational status
- Status of individual components (API, builds, notifications, etc.)
- Active incidents (if any)
- Scheduled maintenance (if any)
- Link to the full status page

**Use case:** Quickly determine if build failures are due to Travis CI infrastructure issues or your code.

**Example output:**
```
Travis CI Service Status
================================================================================

Overall Status: ✓ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL
Last Updated: 2025-11-11T00:55:49.971Z

Service Components:

Use `travis_compareBuilds` to understand what changed between two builds:

```
Ask Claude: "Compare Travis builds 276783990 and 276783991"
Ask Claude: "Why did build 100 pass but build 101 fail?"
```

This returns a detailed comparison showing:
- Build states (passed/failed) with visual indicators
- Repository and branch information
- Commit differences (SHA, message, author, date)
- Build duration comparison
- Timeline (started/finished times)
- Job-by-job comparison with configurations
- Pass/fail summary for each build
- Smart recommendations for next steps

**Example output:**
```

Optimization Recommendations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📦 Dependency Caching:
  • Enable Travis CI's built-in cache for dependencies
  • Add to .travis.yml:
    cache:
      directories:
        - node_modules  # for Node.js
        - ~/.npm
        - ~/.cache/pip  # for Python
        - vendor/bundle # for Ruby
  • Use 'npm ci' instead of 'npm install' for faster, reproducible builds

Build Artifact Caching:
  • Cache compiled/built artifacts between builds
  • Add build output directories to cache configuration
  • Consider incremental compilation if supported by your tooling
  • Example: cache: { directories: ['dist', 'build', '.next'] }

Test Optimization:
  • Split tests across multiple jobs for parallel execution
  • Use test sharding/splitting based on timing data
  • Consider running unit tests before slower integration tests
  • Run only affected tests for PR builds
  • Example: Use build matrix to run test suites in parallel

General Best Practices:
  • Use 'fast_finish: true' in build matrix to fail fast
  • Leverage build stages for dependent job execution
  • Consider conditional builds (skip builds for doc-only changes)
  • Monitor build times regularly and set up alerts for regressions

Job Duration Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slowest jobs:
  • Job #276783990.1: 5m 30s
  • Job #276783990.2: 5m 15s
  • Job #276783990.3: 5m 10s

⚠ Slowest job takes over 5 minutes - consider optimization strategies above

Next Steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Review the recommendations above
2. Update your .travis.yml with caching configuration
3. Monitor subsequent build times for improvements
4. Use 'travis_compareBuilds' to compare before/after optimization
```

**Use cases:**
- Speed up slow builds with targeted recommendations
- Reduce CI costs by optimizing build efficiency
- Identify caching opportunities automatically
- Get actionable steps to improve build performance
- Learn CI/CD best practices through intelligent analysis
- Validate that your builds are following optimization guidelines

## Setup

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run the automated setup script:

```bash
cd mcp-travis
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Check system requirements (Node.js 18+)
- Install dependencies
- Build the project
- Configure environment variables (prompts for your Travis CI API token)
- Set up Claude Desktop integration automatically

After setup completes, just **restart Claude Desktop** and you're ready to go!

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

#### Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Node.js | 18+ |

### Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Configure the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TRAVIS_API_URL` | Travis CI API endpoint | `https://api.travis-ci.com` |
| `TRAVIS_API_TOKEN` | Your Travis CI API token | `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `TRAVIS_USER_AGENT` | User agent for API requests | `mcp-travis/0.1` |

> **Note:** Travis CI API v3 is used. Ensure your token has API access.

## Development

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

The server runs over stdio (MCP) and prints minimal startup logs.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Using with MCP Clients

Add an entry to your MCP-compatible client pointing to `mcp-travis` (the built binary) and ensure the environment variables are available in the client's environment/session.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-travis": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/mcp-travis/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "TRAVIS_API_URL": "https://api.travis-ci.com",
        "TRAVIS_API_TOKEN": "your_travis_token_here",
        "TRAVIS_USER_AGENT": "mcp-travis/0.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Getting your Travis CI API token:**
1. Go to https://travis-ci.com (or your Travis CI instance)
2. Click on your profile picture → Settings
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Find the "API authentication" section
