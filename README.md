# mcp-travis

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Travis CI as tools/resources.

## Usage

Once you've seen you triggered a build right inside of Claude, you can then go to the repository in question:

As you can see it's been triggered by Travis MCP. What's more, if you have a build number that you want to restart, you can do that as well:

Things you need to make sure of is that you have `mcp-travis` activated, see below:

Below I'll explain more about what you can do with the Travis MCP server.

## Features

### Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `travis:recent-builds?repo=owner/name&limit=20` | Retrieve recent builds for a repository with optional limit |
| `travis:env-vars?repo=owner/name` | Get environment variables for a repository |
| `travis:build-log?jobId=123456789` | Fetch build log for a specific job ID |

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `travis.triggerBuild` | Trigger a build for a repository/branch with optional config overrides |
| `travis.restartBuild` | Restart a build using its build ID |
| `travis.cancelBuild` | Cancel a build using its build ID |

## Setup

### Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Node.js | 18+ |

### Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Configure the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TRAVIS_API_URL` | Travis CI API endpoint | `https://api.travis-ci.com` |
| `TRAVIS_API_TOKEN` | Your Travis CI API token | `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `TRAVIS_USER_AGENT` | User agent for API requests | `mcp-travis/0.1` |

> **Note:** Travis CI API v3 is used. Ensure your token has API access.

## Development

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

The server runs over stdio (MCP) and prints minimal startup logs.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Using with MCP Clients

Add an entry to your MCP-compatible client pointing to `mcp-travis` (the built binary) and ensure the environment variables are available in the client's environment/session.
